Data have been organized and can be accessed via https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pkkPL2qP8TPXNJGwJg244v1lNM3S4lib?usp=share_link.
In your working directory, there should be a 'data' folder with all the datasets
'PG_data' folder: all the pre-generated data
'PG_data/GSEA_result' folder: all the GSEA output data

This is the first part which is mainly for omics analysis (CCLE).
The second part (another R file - [code_DTLearner](https://github.com/Ofek-Lin/Yu_Lin_MSc_code_DTLearner.git)) contains the code for machine learning and clinical prediction (survival & therapy response).
The first part contains the necessary code to generate the data for the second part.
